# Philosophy

## Why CapsuleUI?

CapsuleUI was developed to address the challenges associated with building user interfaces in heterogeneous and large-scale web applications, particularly those utilizing microfrontend architectures. In projects where multiple frameworks, static HTML, and server-rendered content coexist, duplicated UI element implementations lead to technical debt, inconsistencies, and high maintenance overhead. Even for simple elements like buttons, managing visual variants, sizes, and behaviors using classes and custom logic becomes increasingly error-prone and difficult to support.

## Why Web Components?

Web Components offer a standardized browser technology that is framework-agnostic and delivers consistent behavior and encapsulation. This technology enables the development of UI components that remain interoperable with any modern frontend ecosystem, including React, Vue, static HTML, and server-rendered stacks. Attribute-based reactivity and native encapsulation ensure predictable and maintainable component logic, regardless of the hosting environment.

## Why a CLI?

The CapsuleUI CLI facilitates the structured, scalable adoption of the component library. Rather than requiring manual copying or ad-hoc integration, the CLI automates file generation, prefix configuration, dependency upgrades, and project initialization. This method increases reliability, ensures consistency, and lowers adoption barriers across different environments.

## Inspiration

CapsuleUI is inspired by systematic component libraries such as shadcn/ui and aims to provide similar design system opportunities using Web Components as the baseline technology. The goal is to offer a universal, extensible, standards-based foundation that is readily adaptable to any project and any development stack.
